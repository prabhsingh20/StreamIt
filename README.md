- **Responsive Design**: Seamless user experience across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
- **Built with React.js**: Structured with React for a clean, maintainable architecture.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool to speed up the development process and improve performance.
- **CSS**: For custom styling and ensuring the app is fully responsive.
- **Movie Database API** (or other movie API): Used to fetch movie data (e.g., titles, descriptions, images) dynamically.
