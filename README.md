# StreamIt

## Project Description

This is a simple movie application built using **React.js** that showcases my design skills. The application allows users to view movie details and provides an interactive interface. It's a demonstration of how I approach web design and user interface (UI) implementation. The focus is on creating a smooth, visually appealing, and responsive experience for users, along with a solid structure using React.

### Features:
- Display of popular movies
- Interactive UI elements
- Movie details, including title, description, and image
- Built with React.js

---

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** – Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Vite** – A modern, fast build tool for React projects, providing a quicker development experience.
- **CSS** – For styling the components and making the app responsive.
- **Movie Database API** (or any other movie API) – To fetch movie data for display.
